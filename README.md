The blog is organized into several sections:
- **Daily Plans**: My goals and tasks for each day.
- **Learning Notes**: Detailed notes on what I've learned about Web3, blockchain, and related technologies.
- **Projects**: Descriptions and updates on the projects I’m working on as part of my learning process.
- **Resources**: A collection of resources, including articles, tutorials, and tools that have been helpful in my journey.
